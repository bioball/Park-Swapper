ParkSwap
========

####Give a ride, get a spot!####
In any busy city, there are people spending too much time driving around looking for a parking spot. At the same time, there are people who walk too far to get to their car. This app aims to connect these people, so the parkers can give people rides back to their car, and take their parking spot afterwards.

This project is maintained by [Dan Chao](http://www.github.com/bioball), [Joseph Toney](http://www.github.com/chip2int) and [Yong-Soo Chung](http://www.github.com/yongsoo), and was built as a student project at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/).

Usage
-----

####If you are parking####
Select "I want a spot", and you will be shown a list of parking spots. This list will only show people within a mile radius of you, and will provide their parking spot address, distance from you, plus the person's current address.

Clicking an entry will show you the person's picture, as well as buttons to call and navigate.

####If you want a ride to your car####
Select "I want a ride", then enter your car's parking location. Enable location tracking if the browser requests it. Upon submit, your information will be sent to our servers, and we will try to connect you to a parker. 

If somebody is coming to pick you up, you will recieve a text from us, including a link to go back to view that person's profile picture, as well as a button to call them.

*Note: Your search will time out after 10 minutes.*
